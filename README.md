# KYVE - Source Registry

The **Source Registry** serves as the reference for all launched pools on the KYVE Network, covering both the Mainnet `kyve-1` and Testnet `kaon-1`. It provides comprehensive information about the launched sources of a specific chain, with a primary focus on listing the essential `block_source_id` and `state_source_id`. Whether you are a KYVE Network participant or developer, this repository is your go-to resource for staying informed about the network's pool configurations and statuses.
